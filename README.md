**RxDeep** provides fast and precise[<sup>*</sup>](#precision) reactive state management, in a flexible and unopinionated manner. Make changes at any point on the state tree, and listen to changes on particular parts of your tree, with a precision emission system that ensures you only get values when something has truly changed[<sup>*</sup>](#precision).

### Example Usage

â–· Create a state object:

```ts
import { State } from 'rxdeep';

const state = new State([ { name: 'John' }, { name: 'Jack' }, { name: 'Jill' } ]);
```

â–· Listen to changes on `'name'` property of index 1 on the list:
```ts
state.sub(1).sub('name').subscribe(console.log);     // --> logs `Jack`
```

â–· You can modify the top-level state:
```ts
state.value = [ { name: 'Julia' }, ...state.value ]; // --> logs `John`, since `John` is index 1 now
```

â–· Or mid-level states:
```ts
state.sub(1).value = { name: 'Josef' };              // --> logs `Josef`
```

â–· Or another sub-state with the same address:
```ts
state.sub(1).sub('name').value = 'Jafet';            // --> logs `Jafet`
```

â–· [RxJS](https://rxjs.dev) interop:
```ts
import { interval } from 'rxjs';
import { map } from 'rxjs/operators';

interval(1000)
.pipe(map(i => ({ name: `Jarvis #${i}`})))
.subscribe(state.sub(1));                            // --> logs `Jarvis #0`, `Jarvis #1`, `Jarvis #2`, ...
```

### UI Frameworks

**RxDeep** is completely framework agnostic. It is also by no means limited to use on frontend (though that is understandably most common use-case).
Due to it being based on [RxJS](https://rxjs.dev) and having high interop with it, you can easily use it anywhere that you can use RxJS.

Because of its precise change emissions, using **RxDeep** in conjuction with popular UI frameworks should actually speed them up (since
it results in less burden for the underlying change detection mechanisms of these frameworks).

### Precision

Precision means that `State`s (nodes on the state-tree) only emit values when there is a change to them (or when a change is directly issued
to them or some other `State` representing the same address on the state-tree). **RxDeep** is as precise as it can get without sacrificing performance.
This precision is sufficient for most common use-cases. However, if you need absolutely precise emissions on a particular use-case, 
it allows you to trade-off performance for that extra precision.
